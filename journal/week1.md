# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Required Homework 

1. I watched the videos on how to ask technical questions, Commit your code and also the on the grading was going to work. Main things that I got from both videos: 

    -  Besides being respectful when asking questions, always do previous research, provide steps performed when troubleshooting, and provide as much context as possible. 
    -  Sometimes "more could be less." When submitting the summaries, try to be consize and provide as much detail as possible within the journals. 
    -  It is always very important to commit our code before we shut down any environment after editing.

2. Watch Week 1 - Live Stream/ Containerize Application (Dockerfiles, Docker Compose)/ Write a Flask Backend Endpoint for Notifications/ Write a React Page for Notifications / Run DynamoDB Local Container and Run Postgres Container and ensure those work. - I decided to summarize all those together since one was the continuation of the other and so on. 

I'm not going to lie, the first part of the week was tough. I was working with VS Code locally because Gitpod was acting weird for me. However, I started to have issues opening the ports with VS Code. I learned that Windows have certains firewalls that don't allow you to open up such ports without having issues. When doing my search about this issue, I saw multiple potential answers such as downloading the latest Python version, or running a Linux CLI. Unfortunately, nothing was working, so I decided to give Gitpod a second chance. Since then, we've been getting along just fine. 

After I started working with Gitpod, I was able to successfully install Docker as well as Postgres and DynamoDB within _Docker-compose.yml_ .

I was able to successfully get data back from the Backend/Notifications page.
