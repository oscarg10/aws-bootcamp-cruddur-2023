# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Homework for week 0 : 

1. Set a Billing alarm - Dollar amount. 

Added billing alert using Cloudwatch. Set up the alarm so it would send me an email in case the 80% of my budget was reached.

2. Create an AWS Budget - Credits with an 80% threshold alert. 

VEry similar to the billing alert, I created a $10 budget that will notify me if I go past 75% of it.
